    "response": "I'm unable to generate custom images on demand. However, I can guide you on how you can use AI-powered tools like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or image generation platforms to create an image of an elephant dancing. One popular AI tool you can use is DALL-E by OpenAI. You can provide a text description of an elephant dancing, and the AI model can generate an image based on that description.\n\nRemember to always verify the source and authenticity of AI-generated images before sharing them, as they may not always be accurate or depict real-world scenarios.",
